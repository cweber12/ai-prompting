          <h2>What is Prompting?</h2>
          <p>
            Prompting is the process of entering information, questions, or instructions (“prompts”) into a 
            Generative AI tool to guide its responses. The quality and specificity of your prompts have a major 
            impact on the usefulness and accuracy of the AI’s output. After you submit a prompt, the AI analyzes 
            your input and generates a response based on patterns it has learned during training.

          <h2>How to Create Effective Prompts</h2>
          <p><strong>Be specific:</strong> Clearly describe what you want. Instead of “Write a story,” try 
            “Write a short, funny story for children about a robot who learns to dance.”
          </p>
          <p><strong>Provide context:</strong> Add details about the topic, audience, tone, or format you 
            want.
          </p>
          <p><strong> Ask the AI to take on a role:</strong> Such as “Act as if you are a 
            personal trainer.”
          </p>
          <p><strong>Specify the format:</strong> Tell AI how to present the response, like “Provide a 
            bullet-point summary.”
          </p>
          <p><strong>List what you want included or excluded:</strong> Add instructions such as “Do include 
            tomatoes. Don’t include wheat.”
          </p>
          <p><strong>Give examples:</strong> Share a sample sentence or paragraph to show the style or structure 
            you want (but avoid copyrighted material).
          </p>
          <p><strong>Consider tone and audience:</strong> Specify who the output is for and the tone you want, 
            like “Make it formal and suitable for business communication.”
          </p>
          <p><strong>Iterate and refine:</strong> Start with a basic prompt and build on it, adding more detail 
            or correcting mistakes as you go.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Ask for help:</strong> If you’re unsure, ask the AI to suggest prompts or tell you what 
            information it needs.

          <h2>Why Prompting Matters</h2>
          <p>
            Well-crafted prompts help you get more accurate, relevant, and useful results from AI tools. They reduce misunderstandings and improve the quality of the AI’s responses. Remember, AI-generated content can sometimes be inaccurate, misleading, or inappropriate, so always review and verify outputs before using or sharing them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> Before using AI tools for work or study, review your organization’s guidelines. For example, Harvard provides specific guidance and collections of prompts for educational use.
