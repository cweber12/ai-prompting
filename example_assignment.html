    <p>
      For this assignment, you will choose one of the four children’s books you read and write a review of it in three parts:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Book summary</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Personal response</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Critical connections</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      To write your review you will use both large language model Artificial Intelligence and your own words and ideas. Here are the steps you will need to follow to complete the assignment:
    </p>
    <div class="assignment-step">
      <ol>
        <li>
           Prompt ChatGPT or a similar text generation AI tool to write a draft review
          <br />
          <button class="guideline-btn" type="button" onclick="toggleDropdown('dropdown-articulate-learning-draft')">How this step fits UW Writing Guideline 2</button>
          <div id="dropdown-articulate-learning-draft" class="guideline-dropdown" style="display:none;">
            <p>
              This step aligns with Guideline 2: <strong>Articulate Learning Goals for Writing</strong> and the recommendation to explore various technologies for composing, helping students use digital tools to support their writing process.

          Copy and paste this review into a blank document
        </li>
        <li>
          Read the review and revise/edit it in three ways, using track changes:
          <ol type="a" class="sub-step">
            <li>
              <strong>Style:</strong> Delete, add, or revise for strange words or awkward phrasing
              <br />

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Voice:</strong> Would you use those words or phrases? If not, change words and phrases to sound like something you would actually say
              <br />

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Content:</strong> Is the review accurate? Does it leave out something important or get some details wrong? Add or revise phrases or sentences as needed to make the review clear and complete
              <br />
              <button class="guideline-btn" type="button" onclick="toggleDropdown('dropdown-writing-process-content')">How this fits UW Writing Guideline 3</button>

        </li>
        <li>
          Add a paragraph discussing this title as a banned book: Why do you think it was banned? What might the impact be on libraries, schools, or children if this book is no longer on the shelves? Which of our course themes seem most relevant to this book?
          <br />

      <ul>
        <li>“Yes, it was to prompt the AI to write a review about a children’s book, and I was surprised because it just felt so different from the way that I write.”</li>
        <li>“I feel like I followed the instructions pretty thoroughly and was really excited. Other than that, I think overall I was just really excited.”</li>
        <li>“We read a children’s book and then we were supposed to ask ChatGPT to make a review...then edit it into our own words.”</li>
        <li>“I was kind of shocked that we were allowed to use AI. I wasn’t expecting that kind of change. And a few words I probably wouldn’t have used.”</li>
        <li>“I think I was, it was a bit confusing because most professors don’t let you use ChatGPT. It was difficult to change back some of the words that ChatGPT used.”</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="responses-challenges" class="response-dropdown">
      <ul>
        <li>“I feel like starting with AI and editing it improves my learning, but there’s things that I feel like I would benefit a whole lot from changing.”</li>
        <li>“Trying to get the AI to write a comprehensive book review was challenging until I found one I was comfortable reviewing and revising.”</li>
        <li>“It took elements from the real story and said they happened in the wrong order—ChatGPT likes to use dashes instead of commas. That was annoying to edit out.”</li>
        <li>“Reading and seeing the response to my prompt was challenging because I’ve just never really done that before.”</li>
        <li>“Prompting it for a complete review meant it sometimes wrote things not coming to your mind. So I think that was definitely a challenge.”</li>
        <li>“Sometimes it gave something that felt very flat. For a book review, I needed transitions to be present so that the review flowed a little bit better.”</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="student-suggestions" class="response-dropdown">
      <ul>
        <li>"I would have liked the option to use AI rather than being required to use it. Including the option makes it clear what was AI and what was not."</li>
        <li>"It helps to see not just the AI output, but also the prompts you gave and the different responses you got. That way, you can show what you changed and why."</li>
        <li>"What you prompt AI to do is important. The prompt shows your understanding of the material and what you're asking it to do."</li>
        <li>"If you give a vague prompt and don't try to get more detail, it shows you may not understand the material as well as it seems."</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="responses-closing-questions" class="response-dropdown">
      <ul>
        <li>Um, I’m definitely interested in knowing if more professors and classes would actually push understanding and critical thinking about material.</li>
        <li>Um, I would say like AI, like really speeds up on what you're doing. But I feel like a lot of courses are not doing that, which is a little surprising.</li>
        <li>I just think that because it is so prevalent and that, like, it’s used more for, like, STEM-related versus writing classes and stuff.</li>
        <li>Whenever you're using AI, make sure to fact‐check and don't trust it fully—research thoroughly instead of just using the first thing it gives you.</li>
        <li>Something that I would like is that some courses do not state clear expectations around AI—like, do our own thing or be inspired by AI, I guess.</li>
        <li>“There’s definitely a lot of interest in AI now because of the hype—I think there are a lot of interesting things to consider about it.”</li>
